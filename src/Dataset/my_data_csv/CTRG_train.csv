The midline structure is in the middle. The sulcus, cistern, and subarachnoid hogwash are widened, and the gyrus is smaller. Thorax is symmetrical, no abnormality is found in rib and chest wall soft tissue. The lung window shows increased bilateral lung markings, increased bilateral lung transparency, bronchiectasis in the posterior segment of the right upper lung, the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe and the tongue segment of the left upper lung, patchy fuzzy shadows in the right middle lung and both lower lungs, and small bilateral pulmonary hili.

A little inflammation in both lungs. Left breast calcification, coronary calcification. Low density focus of liver.","Thorax is symmetrical, and local density of multiple thoracic vertebrae and ribs is increased and expanded. The lung window shows that bilateral lung markings are increased and thickened, the light transmittance of the lung field is slightly reduced, and soft tissue mass is seen in the lower lobe of the left lung, about 8.0 in size × 6.2cm, uneven density, blurry boundary, spotted high-density shadow can be seen in it, and the left lower lobe bronchus is narrow and occluded; The interlobular septum of the left lung is thickened, and the pericardium, the left interlobular pleura, and the left extensive visceral pleura can see multiple nodular protuberances: scattered patchy fuzzy shadows can be seen in both lungs; Multiple tiny nodules and some calcifications can be seen in both lungs, especially in the left lung; The right hilum of lung is not large. The heart shadow is not large, the coronary artery is calcified, the morphology of large vessels is normal, and multiple small lymph nodes are seen in the mediastinum and bilateral armpits.

Low density focus of thyroid.,"After radiotherapy and chemotherapy for small cell carcinoma of the right lung, irregular soft tissue density shadow can be seen at the right hilum of the lung, with unclear boundary, surrounding the right hilum of the lung, with a large section of about 2.0 × 2.7 cm, moderate enhancement on enhanced scan; The markings of the remaining lungs are increased and disordered, and locally interweave into a network. Multiple irregular light transmission areas are seen between them. Slightly high-density fuzzy shadows are seen in the upper and lower lobes of the right lung, and the left pulmonary hilum is not large. Slightly large lymph nodes can be seen in the mediastinum.
