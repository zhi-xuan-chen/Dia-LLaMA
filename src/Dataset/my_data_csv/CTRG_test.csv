The cortex of the second front rib on the left side is twisted, and old fracture is considered.","The cortex of the second front left rib is distorted. Thorax is symmetrical. The lung window shows that the bilateral lung markings are clear and natural. The lung field has good transparency. The diameter of some bronchi in the lower lobe of the right lung is widened. Patchy high-density shadows can be seen around. Multiple nodules are seen in both lungs, about 2-4m up to now. The larger one is located in the lateral segment of the middle lobe of the right lung, about 3 * 4mm in size. The calcification focus in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung is not large. The shape of heart shadow and heart big vessels is normal, and no obvious mass or enlarged lymph node is found in mediastinum. No pleural effusion or pleural thickening."

Bilateral lung markings are increased and disordered, interwoven into a network, and flocculent fuzzy shadows are seen between them. Bilateral pulmonary hili are not large.
