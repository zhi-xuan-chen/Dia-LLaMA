# Dia-LLaMA: Towards Large Language Model-driven CT Report Generation

This is the official GitHub repository of the paper ["Dia-LLaMA: Towards Large Language Model-driven CT Report Generation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16386)

## Getting Started

1. Before you run the code, you need to create a virtual environment and activate it via the following command:

```bash
# create environment
conda create --name dia-llama python=3.9
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements
conda activate dia-llama
```

2. Once the virtual environment is created, you should download the model weight from the huggingface repository [Dia-LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/Trusure/Dia-LLaMA/tree/main).

3. And then, you should prepare the dataset. You can also download them from huggingface.
